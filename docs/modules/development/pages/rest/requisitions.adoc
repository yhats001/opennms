= Requisitions

RESTful service to the {page-component-title} Provisioning Requisitions.
In this API, these "groups" of nodes are aptly named and treated as requisitions.

This current implementation supports CRUD operations for managing provisioning requisitions.
Requisitions are first POSTed and no provisioning (import/synchronize) operations are taken.
This is done so that a) the XML can be verified and b) so that the operations can happen at a later time.
They are moved to the deployed state (put in the active requisition repository) when an import is run.

If a request says that it gets the active requisition, that means it returns the pending requisition (being edited for deployment) if there is one, otherwise it returns the deployed requisition.
Note that anything that says it adds/deletes/modifies a node, interface, etc. in these instructions is referring to modifying that element from the requisition, not from the database itself.
That will happen upon import/synchronization.

You may write requisition data if the authenticated user is in the provision, rest, or admin roles.

| `/requisitions/\{name}/import?rescanExisting=false`                   | Similar to the above import command, but existing nodes are not scanned until the next rescan interval. Only newly added/removed nodes are updated.
