NOTE: The default offset is 0.
The default limit is 10 results.
To get all results, use limit=0 as a parameter on the URL (i.e., GET /nodes?limit=0).

Additionally, anywhere you use "id" in the queries below, you can use the foreign source and foreign ID separated by a colon instead (e.g., GET /nodes/fs:fid).

== DELETEs (Removing Data)

Perform a DELETE to the singleton URLs specified in <<rest-api-nodes-put, PUT>> above to delete that object.

NOTE: Deletion of nodes, ipinterfaces, and services is asynchronous so it will return 202 (ACCEPTED).
Deletion of snmpinterfaces and categories is synchronous calls so will return 204 (NO_CONTENT) on success.
