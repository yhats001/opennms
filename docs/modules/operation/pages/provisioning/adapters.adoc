= Adapters

The {page-component-title} Provisiond API also supports provisioning adapters (plugins) for integration with external systems during the provisioning import phase.
When node entities are added, updated, deleted, or receive a configuration management change event, {{page-component-title}} will call the adapter for the provisioning activities with integrated systems.

Currently, {page-component-title} supports the following adapters:

To configure this adapter, edit the `opennms.properties` file and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:
